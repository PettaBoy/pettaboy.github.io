Are you a music lover? Do you really want to play a music keyboard but cannot afford one?
If your answers are yes, then you'll surely like this software!
Virtual Music Keyboard, as its name suggests, emulates a real-life music keyboard(MuK) on a computer system. You can play the
keyboard either with your mouse or your computer keyboard(CompK).
(If you are wondering what a music keyboard is, it is just like a piano, but with added abilities like changing programs
(instruments in music language) and a metronome(what people familiar with music might call a tempo or beats per minute(bpm)).)

Usage
-----

If you are new to music and the MuK, it is highly recommended to learn about the basics of playing a MuK before using this
application. You can check out websites like www.pianolessons.com or www.skoove.com for tutorials on how to play the
MuK.

Once you know the basics, you can start playing the MuK either with the mouse or with the CompK.
Make note of the following shortcuts if you want to play the MuK with the CompK:

			Key		|	Note
			Tab		|	C3
			Q		|	D3
			W		|	E3
			E		|	F3
			R		|	G3
			T		|	A3
			Y		|	B3
			U		|	C4
			I		|	D4
			O		|	E4
			P		|	F4
			[		|	G4
			]		|	A4
			\		|	B4
			Shift Right	|	C5
			/		|	D5
			.		|	E5
			,		|	F5
			M		|	G5
			N		|	A5
			B		|	B5
			V		|	C6
			C		|	D6
			X		|	E6
			Z		|	F6
			Shift Left	|	G6
			1		|	C#3/Db3
			2		|	D#3/Eb3
			4		|	F#3/Gb3
			5		|	G#3/Ab3
			6		|	A#3/Bb3
			8		|	C#4/Db4
			9		|	D#4/Eb4
			-		|	F#4/Gb4
			=		|	G#4/Ab4
			Backspace	|	A#4/Bb4
			'		|	C#5/Db5
			;		|	D#5/Eb5
			K		|	F#5/Gb5
			J		|	G#5/Ab5
			H		|	A#5/Bb5
			F		|	C#6/Db6
			D		|	D#6/Eb6
			A		|	F#6/Gb6

You can also change settings like the channel through which it plays, the program number, velocity with which the note is hit
(roughly means volume) and sustain(for how long the key plays).(You might find that sustain might not work properly, so you can
pretty much ignore it.) Keep in mind that this keyboard uses the fluidsynth plugin to play the sounds, and fluidsynth supports
General MIDI specifications. Thus, channel 9 is used for playing percussion instruments.

This keyboard also comes with a metronome inside it. Just press start to activate it, and stop to deactivate. This metronome uses
beeps to indicate tempo. You can change the bpm and time signature of the metronome.
This metronome is only a minimal one. There are plans to expand the metronome features in the future.

Known Issues
------------

Whenever a key is pressed to play a corresponding note in the keyboard, the key will play multiple times. This is a feature of the
GUI code used for this program, and a workaround has not been found for this yet, unfortunately.
